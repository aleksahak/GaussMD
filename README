GaussMD is a utility code to extract geometric information, structures, and plots out of ab initio molecular dynamics simulation outputs of Gaussian0X. GaussMD uses a highly versatile input that allows users to flexibly define data types needed for extraction or calculation out of the supplied trajectory file.
